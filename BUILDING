# Building Instructions

The ModulOS image can be built by running the `make` command in the root directory of the source tree. This will create the `obj/modulos.img` which can be copied to a drive. Optionally, debugging symbols can be found in `obj/modulos-dbg`.

By default, debugging related logging is disabled and optimizations are enabled. This can be changed by uncommenting the line starting with `#CDEBUG` in the top level Makefile.

## Cross Compilation Instructions

- binutils 2.44 was build with the following configuration: `--target=x86_64-elf --program-prefix=x86_64-elf- --with-sysroot --disable-nls --disable-werror`

- gcc 14.2.0 was build with the following configuration: `--target=x86_64-elf --program-prefix=x86_64-elf- --disable-nls --enable-languages=c --without-headers`

The version of binutils and gcc should not matter as long as they are recent

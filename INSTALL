# Installing Instructions

The ModulOS image can be built by running the `make` command in the root directory of the source tree. This will create the `obj/modulos.img` which can be copied to a drive. Optionally, debugging symbols can be found in `obj/modulos-dbg`.

By default, debugging related logging is disabled and optimizations are enabled. This can be changed by uncommenting the line `#export DEBUG = 1` in the top level Makefile.

The built modules can be customized by commenting/uncommenting the various `export BUILD_<MODULENAME> = 1` lines near the beginning of the top level Makefile

ModulOS must be compiled with clang/lld. The following packages are also needed:
- mtools
- x86_64-efi grub
- llvm binary utilities

On debian based systems, all dependencies can be installed with the apt package manager:
`apt install clang lld llvm grub-efi-amd64-bin mtools`
